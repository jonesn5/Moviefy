# Moviefy
CSE201 Project repository
# Description 
This is the course group project of group 20 for CSE 201. Group members include: Karim Sammorui, Nick Jones, Ryan Winters, Sam Kuhbander, and Sherveen Menon. Our project is Moviefy.
A product that lets you search for movies and find what you'll be watching next. Moviefy has a filterable list of movies that you can use to find new things to watch, it also has a rating 
and a comments section that allows the community to provide feedback. 
# Prerequisities 
The only prerequisite is a connection to the internet, as this will be running on the web.
# Installation
To install the necessary files to run the program you need to run the build script, which for now is titled "test.bat". 
This script creates two directories (or folders) in the directory where it is run. It will create the XAMPP directory and the moviefy directory, which is inside the XAMPP directory.
The moviefy directory is where all the pages for the website are stored. 
When you run the script a browser window will open and automatically download an exe file called "xampp-windows-x64-8.0.3-0-VS16-installer.exe". 
This file is the setup for the server that the project runs on. Run the installer and install the files into the XAMPP directory that was created. 
Move the moviefy directory into the htdocs directory that the XAMPP installer installed to the XAMPP folder. 
Next run "xampp-control.exe" program which will open up the server control pannel. From there you need to start the Apache (1st option) server and the MySQL (2nd option) server.
Then open your broswer of choice and navigate to http://localhost/moviefy/index.php 
This will take you to the login page.
